# CoolFramework

A C#.NET library for Object Oriented containers and publish-subscribe
inter-component middleware.  This has been built to allow a more abstract
level of composability based on role that has a more loosely defined
contract than interfaces or inheritance provide.

Containers

* Bunch

* Groups

* UniqueSet

* AvlTree


Middleware

* MessageBus

* Message

* MessageSubscriber
